Update: I just realized that it has just been displaying "Hello World!" at the address above. I've been so busy with everything this semester that I didn't notice I must have broke the mirror somehow. The project did not go as well as originally planned, as I've been struggling with some anxiety lately and feeling overwhelmed due to stress. I'm most definitely getting better though, and hope to fix everything with my project as I've had fun building what it is so far!

Yay looks like its fixed now! But I think I'm gonna take it offline because it is still a work in progress:)
