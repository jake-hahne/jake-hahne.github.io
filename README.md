Update: I just realized that it has just been displaying "Hello World!" at the address above. I've been so busy with everything this semester that I didn't notice I must have broke the mirror somehow. The project did not go as well as originally planned, as I've been struggling with some anxiety lately and feeling overwhelmed due to stress. I'm most definitely getting better though, and hope to fix everything with my project as I've had fun building what it is so far!

Update: Yay looks like its fixed now! But I think I'm gonna take it offline because it is still a work in progress:)

Update 5-08-23: I'm very sorry I didn't have you added as a reporter Dr. Dass, it completely slipped under my rader as this semester has been very hectic, I'm working on a few different components for my project that I hope to have done very soon. I hope your semester has gone well, and I'll be sure to reach out if I have any issues/questions. Feel free to do the same ðŸ˜„
